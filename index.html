                        My resume is full of information but is very impersonal and doesn’t show you what kind of person I am, this website is to help give you a better idea of the kind of person I strive to be.  I grew up in a small farm town east of Columbus, which is where I live today. I graduated high school with about 100 people and went K-12 with the majority.  I spent my summers working on farm equipment and practicing the piano.  I started taking private piano lessons at the age of three and continued through high school, then studied Music Education with an emphasis on piano. I went to the Ohio University School of Music with the hopes of becoming a high school band director but after two years of schooling, I decided that this career path was not for me.  Music was the only plan I had in my life up until this point. I had decided I was going to be a high school band director when I was in middle school, so leaving the school of music was not a decision made lightly.  Now I asked myself what’s next?

                            I had a friend who was building his own gaming PC and he asked me for some help.  It wasn’t long after that I was building one for myself. I had always been proficient with the computer but now I was really starting to understand how it all worked, or so I thought. That’s when I decided to write my first program which sparked the journey that has led me here. I started like everyone else with the notorious “Hello, World” in Java. I signed up for classes not to long after that. I started at Columbus State with a focus on networking, it was something I never had a complete understanding of until I finished my intro courses. Then I moved my way into, programing.  My first course in the subject was a Java class, which really showed me the basics of object-oriented programming. Then I took my first .NET class and started to grow as a developer.

                            In C# I’ve done all the basic class work, creating conditional loops, using and creating class objects, defining methods to run tasks. As well as expanded outside of the class, creating my own libraries and web applications that apply to my life.  One of the projects I have been working on is a NuGet package to simplify the Phillips Hue API.  Phillips Hue lights are programmable lights that use JSON and an API interface to control every aspect of the light through a ZigBee channel. From the color and brightness of the light to defining the room and group that the light is a part of. I have also created a web application for my current work place.  I’ve made a database with a web application to perform basic CRUD operations. This database holds a tip out history for all the servers and bartenders.  Each employee that receives a tip out enters in their information at the end of the night to create a history, so we can find patterns in the data.  Sadly, just before I finished my application corporate implemented their own similar application.  None the less it was a great opportunity to compare my work to the work of other professionals. I saw a tremendous amount of improvement that I can make to my application, things I would have never thought of on my own. My latest project has been with my raspberry pi. I have been trying to find new ways to implement the pie into my life through the IoT.  Right now, my pie is being used as a home entertainment system, where I have linked it up with a share drive on my home file server that hold everything from TV shows and Music to home movies and pictures. Then when life gets tiring, I switch it to the Retro Pie SD card and play my favorite classic Nintendo 64 games to clear my head.

                            Thank you for taking some time to read this and getting to know me better. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss in person why I would be a good fit with your company.  I am very ambitious to start my career in the wonderful world of programming and help innovate the world.
